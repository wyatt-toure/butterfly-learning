## Summary

This is the GitHub repository containing the data and code for the analysis conducted in the manuscript ‘Heliconiini butterflies can learn time-dependent reward associations’. 

You can find a site which walks through the analysis described in the main text at https://wyatt-toure.github.io/butterfly-learning/. Additionally, this repository contains all the code to produce the analyses and figures in the manuscript. 

The code to produce the supplementary results and figures are in the [ESM-code folder](https://github.com/wyatt-toure/butterfly-learning/tree/main/ESM-code). 

The code for the *Heliconius hecale* analysis is located in the file [01-hecale-analysis.Rmd](https://github.com/wyatt-toure/butterfly-learning/blob/main/01-hecale-analysis.Rmd)

The code for the *Dryas iulia* analysis is located in the file [02-dryas-analysis.Rmd](https://github.com/wyatt-toure/butterfly-learning/blob/main/02-dryas-analysis.Rmd)
