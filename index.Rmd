# Background

This site contains the code, model outputs, and data tables for the analyses in the manuscript <span style="text-decoration:underline">'Heliconiini butterflies can learn time-dependent reward associations'</span>

The raw data used to conduct these analyses are available in the file [heliconiini-data.csv](https://github.com/wyatt-toure/butterfly-learning/blob/main/heliconiini-data.csv). 

The raw R code for the *H. hecale* analysis is located in the file [01-hecale-analysis.Rmd](https://github.com/wyatt-toure/butterfly-learning/blob/main/01-hecale-analysis.Rmd)

The raw R code for the *D. iulia* analysis is located in the file [02-dryas-analysis.Rmd](https://github.com/wyatt-toure/butterfly-learning/blob/main/02-dryas-analysis.Rmd).
