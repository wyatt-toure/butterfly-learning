Identity was included as a random effect throughout as well as cage if it did not lead to a singular fit due to no variance being captured by the variable. Hecale, all individuals We initially looked at all individuals—excluding those which did not attempt to feed from both feeders in AM or, more commonly, PM during training (see Hecale activity between time periods section), or did not make any foraging attempts during a final test session. We also established a training criterion given variation in responsiveness to the test during training we identified individuals that correctly adjust their behaviour in AM and PM sessions during training with reinforced feeders. In the Hecale high and low performers section we asked whether these individuals demonstrate evidence of learning by behaving in the same way when presented with unreinforced feeders in the post-training preference test. Initial preference This model asks whether there is a shift in preference for the colour that is rewarding in the morning between time periods. Variables n.morning.colour.initial is the number of choices made for the colour that is rewarding in the morning n.afternoon.colour.initial is the number of choices made for the colour that is rewarding in the afternoon cage is the identity of the cage the individual was tested and trained in id is the identity of the individual butterfly First we remove any individuals who did not make both colour choices in either morning or afternoon during training. data2 = data %&gt;% group_by(id) %&gt;% filter(all(n.correct.training &gt; 0 &amp; n.incorrect.training &gt; 0)) Then we remove individuals who did not respond at all during a session at the final test. data3 = data2 %&gt;% group_by(id) %&gt;% filter(all(n.morning.colour.test &gt; 0 | n.afternoon.colour.test &gt; 0)) Is there a shift in preference for colours when individuals are naive ?

Model Residuals Hecale high and low performers We noticed considerable variation in how flexible individuals were during training i.e., some individuals performed better during training compared to others. In order to see whether high performers showed more evidence of learning than low performers we looked at the initial and trained preferences of butterflies that made a majority (&gt;50%) of correct feeding choices in the final two training days in both the morning and afternoon as well as those that did not meet this criterion. The expectation is that high performers would show more evidence of shifting their preference throughout the day at the final test session. Initial preference High Performers First we will be looking at the shift in preference initially in naive butterflies that were high performers in the experiment. To do so we will remove individuals who did not achieve greater than 50% correct responses in the last 2 days of training data4 = data3 %&gt;% group_by(id) %&gt;% filter(all(prop.correct.training.last.2 &gt; 0.5)) We ask whether individuals who perform well in last 2 days of training shift preference between the time periods initially. Model naive.model.high.performers = glmer(cbind(n.morning.colour.initial, n.afternoon.colour.initial) ~ time.of.day + (1 | cage/id), data= data4, family = binomial) Results term estimate std.error statistic p.value (Intercept) -0.341 0.770 -0.442 0.658 time.of.day2afternoon 0.064 0.246 0.258 0.796 High performers do not significantly shift preference initially. Model Residuals Low Performers Next we will look at individuals which under-performed during training so we extract individuals below the criterion. data5 = data3 %&gt;% group_by(id) %&gt;% filter(any(prop.correct.training.last.2 &lt; 0.51)) We now ask do individuals who were incorrect at high rate shift preference initially? Note we include the line control=glmerControl(optimizer=\"bobyqa\",optCtrl=list(maxfun=2e5)) to change the optimizer since this model initially fails to converge. Model naive.model.low.performers = glmer(cbind(n.morning.colour.initial, n.afternoon.colour.initial) ~ time.of.day + (1 | id), data =data5, family = binomial, control=glmerControl(optimizer=&quot;bobyqa&quot;,optCtrl=list(maxfun=2e5))) Results term estimate std.error statistic p.value (Intercept) -1.579 0.747 -2.115 0.034 time.of.day2afternoon 0.264 0.237 1.111 0.266 Low performers also do not significantly shift their preference between time periods initially. Model Residuals Trained preference Now we will look at trained preferences which were measured after 10 days of training. High Performers We first ask whether individuals who were correct at a high rate during training shift preference when trained. Note here the cage random effect was dropped due to it not capturing any variance leading to a singular fit. Model trained.model.high.performers = glmer(cbind(n.morning.colour.test, n.afternoon.colour.test) ~ time.of.day * final.presentation + (1 | id), data= data4, family = binomial) Results term estimate std.error statistic p.value (Intercept) 0.575 0.298 1.932 0.053 time.of.day2afternoon -0.435 0.173 -2.507 0.012 final.presentationreversed -0.152 0.395 -0.383 0.701 time.of.day2afternoon:final.presentationreversed 0.148 0.248 0.598 0.55 We find that there is a significant shift in preference for the morning colour between time periods among high performing butterflies. When trained these butterflies shift their preference for the morning reward colour by 12% (Figure 1). Figure 1: Data from colour preference trials of H. hecale meeting the training criterion.

Model Residuals Low Performers We now ask whether individuals who were not correct at a high rate shift preference when trained.

Model Residuals Hecale activity between time periods To see whether there was a difference in the total number of choices a butterfly made at a particular time period we used a Poisson generalised linear mixed effect model.

Lines connects individuals across time periods Model Residuals "],["dryas-experiments.html", "Dryas experiments Dryas all individuals Trained preference Dryas high and low performers Dryas activity between time periods", " Dryas experiments In a second experiment, we tested a reduced sample of Dryas iulia, a closely related butterfly, to test if the ability to learn associations was limited to Heliconius. 13 out of 19 D. iulia made both choices in both time periods during training, the remaining 6 were removed from further analyses. An additional individual was removed after making no feeding attempts in the final test. One cage had purple rewarded in the AM and yellow rewarded in the PM with an unreversed final test order (group 1), while the second cage had yellow rewarded in the AM and purple rewarded in the PM with a reversed final test order (group 2). In this sample only Dryas from group 2 met the training criterion (n = 6). However, since the order of the final test has no bearing on how an individual behaves during the training trials, and test order has no effect in H. hecale, we assumed this is unlikely to be problematic. Dryas all individuals Across analyses on Dryas learning performance we again asked whether the time of day influenced: (a) in subsections titled Initial preference, shifts in proportional preference for the colour rewarding in the morning when naïve, using a binomial GLMM with response variable “morning reward colour choices/afternoon reward colour choices” and fixed factor “time of day” (morning or afternoon); (b) in subsections titled Trained preference, shifts in proportional colour preference when trained, using the same specifications. Identity was included as a random effect throughout.
