# Background

This site contains the code, model outputs, and data tables for the analyses in the manuscript <span style="text-decoration:underline">'Heliconiini butterflies can learn time-dependent reward associations'</span>

The raw data used to conduct these analyses are available at the [github repository for this site](https://github.com/wyatt-toure/butterfly-learning/blob/main/heliconiini-data.csv). 

The raw R code for the *H. hecale* analysis is located in 02-hecale-analysis.Rmd and the code for the *D. iulia* analysis is located in the 03-dryas-analysis.Rmd
