"],["hecale-experiments.html", "Hecale experiments Hecale all individuals Hecale high and low performers Hecale activity between time periods", " Hecale experiments Across analyses on H. hecale learning performance we asked whether the time of day influenced: In subsections titled Initial preference - the shifts in proportional preference for the colour rewarding in the morning when naïve, using a binomial GLMM with response variable “morning reward colour choices/afternoon reward colour choices” and fixed factor “time of day” (morning or afternoon); In subsections titled Trained preference - shifts in proportional colour preference when trained, using the same specifications but with the additional fixed factor “presentation order” (standard or reversed). Identity was included as a random effect throughout as well as cage if it did not lead to a singular fit due to no variance being captured by the variable. Hecale all individuals We initially looked at all individuals—excluding those which did not attempt to feed from both feeders in AM or, more commonly, PM during training (see Hecale activity between time periods section), or did not make any foraging attempts during a final test session. We also established a training criterion given observed variation in responsiveness to the learning task throughout training. We identified individuals that correctly adjusted their behaviour in AM and PM sessions during training with reinforced feeders and in the Hecale high and low performers section asked whether these individuals demonstrate evidence of learning by behaving in the same way when presented with unreinforced feeders in the post-training preference test. Initial preference This model asks whether there is a shift in preference for the colour that is rewarding in the morning between time periods. Variables n.morning.colour.initial is the number of choices made for the colour that is rewarding in the morning n.afternoon.colour.initial is the number of choices made for the colour that is rewarding in the afternoon cage is the identity of the cage the individual was tested and trained in id is the identity of the individual butterfly First we remove any individuals who did not make both colour choices in either morning or afternoon during training. data2 = data %&gt;% group_by(id) %&gt;% filter(all(n.correct.training &gt; 0 &amp; n.incorrect.training &gt; 0)) Then we remove individuals who did not respond at all during a session at the final test. data3 = data2 %&gt;% group_by(id) %&gt;% filter(all(n.morning.colour.test &gt; 0 | n.afternoon.colour.test &gt; 0)) Model We now ask with a binomial GLMM whether there a shift in preference for colours when individuals were naive. naive.model = glmer(cbind(n.morning.colour.initial, n.afternoon.colour.initial) ~ time.of.day + (1 | cage/id), data = data3, family = binomial) Results term estimate std.error statistic p.value (Intercept) -1.156 0.991 -1.167 0.243 time.of.day2afternoon 0.147 0.171 0.860 0.39 We see there is no significant shift in preference for the colour that is rewarding in the morning between time periods initially when individuals are naive (p = 0.39 for time of day effect). Model Residuals Trained preference Variables n.morning.colour.test is the number of choices made for the colour that is rewarding in the morning during the final test n.afternoon.colour.test is the number of choices made for the colour that is rewarding in the afternoon during the final test final.presentation is the order of the final test presentation (morning first or afternoon first) cage is the identity of the cage the individual was tested and trained in id is the identity of the individual butterfly Model Now we will be looking at butterflies after training and asking if there is a shift in preference for the colour that is rewarded in the morning based on the time of day when individuals are trained. We include an effect of final presentation. trained.model = glmer(cbind(n.morning.colour.test, n.afternoon.colour.test) ~ time.of.day * final.presentation + (1 | cage/id), data = data3, family = binomial) Results term estimate std.error statistic p.value (Intercept) 0.444 0.456 0.974 0.33 time.of.day2afternoon -0.291 0.158 -1.846 0.065 final.presentationreversed -0.107 0.632 -0.169 0.865 time.of.day2afternoon:final.presentationreversed 0.270 0.192 1.409 0.159 We don’t find a significant shift as a result of time of day (p = 0.06) but the effect size is in the expected direction i.e., a decrease in the morning reward colour preference in the afternoon. Moreover, we don’t see an effect of final presentation (p = 0.86) or an interaction effect of final presentation with time of day (p = 0.16) Model Residuals Hecale high and low performers We noticed considerable variation in how flexible individuals were during training i.e., some individuals performed better during training compared to others. In order to see whether high performers showed more evidence of learning than low performers, we looked at the initial and trained preferences of butterflies that made a majority (&gt;50%) of correct feeding choices in the final two training days in both the morning and afternoon as well as those that did not meet this criterion. The expectation is that high performers would show evidence of shifting their preference throughout the day at the final test session. Initial preference High Performers First we will be looking at the shift in preference based on time of day initially in naive butterflies that were high performers in the experiment. To do so we will remove individuals who did not achieve greater than 50% correct responses in the last 2 days of training data4 = data3 %&gt;% group_by(id) %&gt;% filter(all(prop.correct.training.last.2 &gt; 0.5)) Model We now ask whether individuals who perform well in last 2 days of training shift colour preference between the time periods initially. naive.model.high.performers = glmer(cbind(n.morning.colour.initial, n.afternoon.colour.initial) ~ time.of.day + (1 | cage/id), data= data4, family = binomial) Results term estimate std.error statistic p.value (Intercept) -0.341 0.770 -0.442 0.658 time.of.day2afternoon 0.064 0.246 0.258 0.796 We find no evidence of high performers shifting their colour preference based on time of day initially (p = 0.79) Model Residuals Low Performers Next we look at individuals which under-performed during training so we extract individuals below the criterion. data5 = data3 %&gt;% group_by(id) %&gt;% filter(any(prop.correct.training.last.2 &lt; 0.51)) Model We now ask do individuals who did not make over 50% correct choices at the last 2 days of training shift their colour preference based on time of day initially? Note we include the line control=glmerControl(optimizer=\"bobyqa\",optCtrl=list(maxfun=2e5)) to change the optimizer since this model initially fails to converge. naive.model.low.performers = glmer(cbind(n.morning.colour.initial, n.afternoon.colour.initial) ~ time.of.day + (1 | id), data =data5, family = binomial, control=glmerControl(optimizer=&quot;bobyqa&quot;,optCtrl=list(maxfun=2e5))) Results term estimate std.error statistic p.value (Intercept) -1.579 0.747 -2.115 0.034 time.of.day2afternoon 0.264 0.237 1.111 0.266 Low performers like high performers do not significantly shift their colour preference based on the time of day between time periods initially (p = 0.26). Model Residuals Trained preference We next look at trained preferences which were measured after 10 days of training. High Performers Model We first ask whether individuals who were correct at a higher rate during training shifted their colour preference based on the time of day when trained. Note here the cage random effect was dropped due to it not capturing any variance leading to a singular fit. trained.model.high.performers = glmer(cbind(n.morning.colour.test, n.afternoon.colour.test) ~ time.of.day * final.presentation + (1 | id), data = data4, family = binomial) Results term estimate std.error statistic p.value (Intercept) 0.575 0.298 1.932 0.053 time.of.day2afternoon -0.435 0.173 -2.507 0.012 final.presentationreversed -0.152 0.395 -0.383 0.701 time.of.day2afternoon:final.presentationreversed 0.148 0.248 0.598 0.55 We find that there is a significant shift in preference for the morning colour between time periods among high performing butterflies (p = 0.01). When trained these butterflies shift their preference for the morning reward colour by 12% (Figure 1). Figure 1: Data from colour preference trials of H. hecale meeting the training criterion.

Model Residuals Low Performers We now ask whether individuals who were not correct at a high rate shift preference when trained. Model trained.model.low.performers = glmer(cbind(n.morning.colour.test, n.afternoon.colour.test) ~ time.of.day * final.presentation + (1 | cage/id), data= data5, family = binomial) Results term estimate std.error statistic p.value (Intercept) 0.104 0.988 0.105 0.916 time.of.day2afternoon 0.460 0.391 1.176 0.24 final.presentationreversed 0.406 1.287 0.315 0.753 time.of.day2afternoon:final.presentationreversed -0.317 0.415 -0.764 0.445 No significant shift in preference among low performers. Model Residuals Hecale activity between time periods To see whether there was a difference in the total number of choices a butterfly made at a particular time period we used a Poisson generalised linear mixed effect model. Variables total.activity is the total number of choices (correct and incorrect) a butterfly made in a time period time.of.day is the time period of the trial (morning or afternoon) cage is the identity of the cage the individual was tested and trained in id is the identity of the individual butterfly Model activity.model = glmer(total.activity ~ time.of.day + (1 | cage/id), data= data, family = poisson) Results term estimate std.error statistic p.value (Intercept) 4.270 0.102 41.887 &lt; .001 time.of.day2afternoon -0.346 0.026 -13.082 &lt; .001 On average butterflies make 24 less choices in the afternoon.

An additional individual was removed after making no feeding attempts in the final test. One cage had purple rewarded in the AM and yellow rewarded in the PM with an unreversed final test order (group 1), while the second cage had yellow rewarded in the AM and purple rewarded in the PM with a reversed final test order (group 2). In this sample only Dryas from group 2 met the training criterion (n = 6). However, since the order of the final test has no bearing on how an individual behaves during the training trials, and test order has no effect in H. hecale, we assumed this is unlikely to be problematic. Dryas all individuals Across analyses on Dryas learning performance we again asked whether the time of day influenced: In subsections titled Initial preference - shifts in proportional preference for the colour rewarding in the morning when naïve, using a binomial GLMM with response variable “morning reward colour choices/afternoon reward colour choices” and fixed factor “time of day” (morning or afternoon); In subsections titled Trained preference - shifts in proportional colour preference when trained, using the same specifications. Identity was included as a random effect throughout. First we subset our data to remove any individuals who did not make both colour choices in either morning or afternoon during training. data2 = data %&gt;% group_by(id) %&gt;% filter(all(n.correct.training &gt; 0 &amp; n.incorrect.training &gt; 0)) Furthermore we remove individuals who did not respond at all during a session in final test. data3 = data2 %&gt;% group_by(id) %&gt;% filter(all(n.morning.colour.test &gt; 0 | n.afternoon.colour.test &gt; 0)) Initial preference Model We first ask whether there is there a shift in preference for colours based on the time of day when individuals are naive. naive.model = glmer(cbind(n.morning.colour.initial, n.afternoon.colour.initial) ~ time.of.day + (1 | cage/id), data= data3, family = binomial) Results term estimate std.error statistic p.value (Intercept) 0.511 0.696 0.734 0.463 time.of.day2afternoon 0.367 0.233 1.574 0.116 No, p-value = 0.11 for time of day effect Model Residuals Trained preference Model In this model we ask whether there is a shift in colour preference based on time of day for all butterflies which participated in the experiment. trained.model = glmer(cbind(n.morning.colour.test, n.afternoon.colour.test) ~ time.of.day + (1 | id), data= data3, family = binomial) Results term estimate std.error statistic p.value (Intercept) 0.383 0.293 1.308 0.191 time.of.day2afternoon 0.001 0.102 0.012 0.991 No, p = 0.99 for time of day effect Model Residuals Dryas high and low performers Remove individuals who did not achieve greater than 50% correct responses in last 2 days of training data4 = data3 %&gt;% group_by(id) %&gt;% filter(all(prop.correct.training.last.2 &gt; 0.5)) Initial preference High Performers Model Do individuals who perform well in last 2 days of training shift preference initially naive.model.high.performers = glmer(cbind(n.morning.colour.initial, n.afternoon.colour.initial) ~ time.of.day + (1 |id), data= data4, family = binomial) Results term estimate std.error statistic p.value (Intercept) -0.546 0.466 -1.172 0.241 time.of.day2afternoon 0.536 0.321 1.670 0.095 No, p = 0.09 Model Residuals # pull out individuals below criterion data5 = data3 %&gt;% group_by(id) %&gt;% filter(any(prop.correct.training.last.2 &lt; 0.51)) Model In this model we ask whether lower performing individuals shift their colour preference based on the time of day prior to training. naive.model.low.performers = glmer(cbind(n.morning.colour.initial, n.afternoon.colour.initial) ~ time.of.day + (1 | id), data =data5, family = binomial) Results term estimate std.error statistic p.value (Intercept) 1.333 0.496 2.687 0.007 time.of.day2afternoon 0.148 0.339 0.437 0.662 No, p = 0.66 Model Residuals Trained preference High Performers Model In this model we ask whether higher performing individuals shift their colour preference based on the time of day after training. trained.model.high.performers = glmer(cbind(n.morning.colour.test, n.afternoon.colour.test) ~ time.of.day + (1 | id), data= data4, family = binomial) Results term estimate std.error statistic p.value (Intercept) 1.435 0.398 3.604 &lt; .001 time.of.day2afternoon -1.819 0.195 -9.334 &lt; .001 We find a significant effect of time of day (p &lt; 0.001).
